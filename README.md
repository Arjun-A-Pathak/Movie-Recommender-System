# Movie-Recommender-System
Content-Based Filtering is a recommendation technique that suggests movies to users based on the attributes of the movies themselves, such as genre, director, actors, keywords, or plot description. Instead of focusing on user behavior or ratings, this method examines the characteristics of items the user has previously interacted with.
